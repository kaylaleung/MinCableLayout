# Minimum Spanning Cable Tree

The ABC Utility Company wants to lay cable lines from its field stations to its customers. The locations and the distances between adjacent customers and the field stations are shown in the figure below. The field stations are located at nodes 7, 14, 25, 28, and 40. Remaining nodes show the locations of its customers. The edges show the possible cable routes and the distance between the customers. Customers can be served from any one of these switching stations. Show how company can serve all its customers while minimizing the total cable used. You do not need exclusive cables from field stations to its customers. The cable lines can be extended from customer to another, but all customers must be served from one of its field stations.

* Determine the edges along which the cables must be laid. 
* Show the final layout of the cables lines. 
* Determine total length of the cable used.
* If you could build only one field station that minimizes the total cost of the cable used, which node(s) would you choose for your field station?
